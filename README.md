# Sphinx-Language

Sphinx is a high level, open source, cross-platform compatible programming language still in development.Sphinx aims to become a funtional language with an extended library for mathematical implementations.It's purpose is to be a new mathematical tool  with improved specifications from other popular languages to optimize performance and software development.It seeks to help users of different ages create applications for learning, the work environment or just plain fun.

Some of its language features include:

Easy usage and implementation: It is developer friendly and a high level programming language. It is easy to read and write to ensure a low level of complexity.It's style and program structure allow the language to optimize code and run efficiently with a limitted amount of code lines. It also includes the usage of library methods that werent usable before such as polynomial mathematical calculations, quadratic solutions and much more.

Familiarity: The language aims to be an implementation of an already existing language, therefore being in a familiar language that other users will easily get used to.

Open source: Anyone can download it or access it with a computing device. It is free of charge for the purpose of keeping it a good alternative tool for learning and for the needs of computer science students or developers around the world. 

Cross-Platform compatibility and functionality: It can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, Unix and Macintosh etc.It is flexible and aims to apply features of functionality like interfaces and lambda expressions.

Error Detection: Sphinx will point out errors by changing the color of the line which causes the compilation error.

Installation instructions:
- Downloading github repository zip
- Extract the zip file
- Open the project in Pycharm or any IDE or text editor that allows python language support.
- In the case that you open the project in pycharm and the packages are not installed: You will receive a notification from pycharm to install requirements, click it and it will automatically install all the necessary packages needed for running the project.

Alternative installation steps for installing in Pycharm:
- Fork github repository to your github.
- Copy the repository's url.
- Open pycharm in your device:
In the main menu, click get from version control and paste your github's repository url.
Pycharm with create the virtual environment and it will open the project. If no interpreter for the project appears,add an   interpreter either an existing one that uses python 3.8 or higher or you can configure your own interpreter. If you need help with this step use this link for further instructions: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html#
After you have an interpreter configured:
Click on a file, and wait for errors, then pycharm with notify to install requirements.
Install the requirements, these will be installed automatically. With this, the process of installing the project should be completed.

Now as a reminder the Sphinx Language is still under construction.The language will share similarity with Python and that is still an ongoing process as also other features. Therefore, further instructions will be provided in future occasions.
